# Speed Detector


### Description
This code takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

# Net Salary Calculator

The user is required to input their basic salary and benefits. This totals up to their taxeable income which is then run through an algorithm in JS that computes their net salary, based on the revised figures from KRA, NSSF and NHIF. The links to these values and further relevant information is provided below.
